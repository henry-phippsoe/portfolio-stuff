            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
            Hello, I'm Henry Soeiro.
            I'm probably the best web developer ever of all time, no question about it.
            Currently, I'm flexing my superior HTML skills at Cambridge Rindge & Latin School.
            My journey in being the best has been driven by a curiosity to understand how Leo could possibly ever think in a million years that he is a better coder than me.
            </p>

            <p>When I'm not destroying my weak competition in school, you might find me beating Leo at everything else in life.
            I'm always excited to connect with like-minded individuals, as the idea that they could possibly beat my skills is outrageous.
            </p>

            <p>
            All in all, I would say I'm a humble, incredibly talented and skilled individual/future gazillionaire.
            </p>
